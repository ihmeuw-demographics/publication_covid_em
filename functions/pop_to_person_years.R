#' @title Population to person-years
#'
#' @description Take "population" column representing mid-period population
#'   and compute "person-years".
#'
#' @param dt Dataset to compute person-years for. Must have columns:
#'   * "time_unit" : equals "month", "week", or "day"
#'   * "time_start" : equals value of time. ex: March has time unit "month"
#'       and time start "3".
#'   * "year_start" : used to determine leap year.
#'   * "population" : mid-period population
#' @param num_units Length of time period to multiply by n_days to get person
#'   years for data spanning multiple months or weeks. Should be 1 if data is
#'   weekly or monthly
#' @param week_type `default standard` Type of week reported by country specific VR data
#'   * "iso" Week starts Monday & ends Sunday such that each week has 7 days
#'   * "epi" Week starts Sunday & ends Saturday such that each week has 7 days
#'   * "uk" Week starts Saturday & ends Friday such that each week has 7 days
#'   * "standard" lubridate week returns 7 day weeks starting on Jan 1. where week 53
#'   has 1 or 2 days depending on leap year. We are combining week 53 with week 52
#'   so that the last week 52 has 9 or 8 days
#'
#' @details
#' person-years = mid-period-population * (n-days-in-period / n-days-in-year).
#' 53rd week has either 1 or 2 days depending on whether it's a leap year.
