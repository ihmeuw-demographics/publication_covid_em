#' @title Aggregate from week to month
#'
#' @description Convert weekly data to monthly data, assuming deaths are
#'   evenly distributed through the week for weeks that span multiple months.
#'
#' @param dt \[`data.table()`\]\cr
#'   Dataset with columns "time_start", "time_unit", "year_start", `id_cols`,
#'   and `measure`, where "time_unit" is always "week".
#' @param measure \[`character(1)`\]\cr
#'   Name of column with value to be aggregated.
#' @param id_cols \[`character()`\]\cr
#'   Columns that uniquely identify rows of `dt`. Must contain `time_start`,
#'   `time_unit`, and `year_start`.
#' @param na_rm \[`logical()`\]\cr default (TRUE)
#'   True or False whether nas should be removed from aggregation
#'
#' @return \[`data.table()`\]\cr
#'   Dataset with columns "time_start", "time_unit", "year_start", `id_cols`,
#'   and `measure`, where "time_unit" is always "month".
#'
#' @details Assumes weeks that represent complete 7 day periods past January 1st.
